# Portfolio Projects
## Project 1: [911 calls analysis using Python ](https://github.com/AdityaDabrase/DSPortfolioProjects/tree/main/DS-ML/911%20calls%20analysis)
- Description: Analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle. (Exploratory data analysis and Data visualization)
- Skills used:  the skills required include proficient data cleaning and preprocessing abilities to handle emergency call data effectively. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills are crucial to understand patterns and trends in the data. Additionally, strong data visualization skills using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are essential to present insights visually. If the analysis involves temporal data, skills in time series analysis become relevant. For projects dealing with geographic data, proficiency in geographic data analysis is necessary to make sense of location-based information.
